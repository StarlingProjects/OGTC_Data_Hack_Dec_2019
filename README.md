# OGTC_Data_Hack_Dec_2019
A Data Hack at OGTC in Aberdeen on 2 December 2019

We had 16 participants, who were data scientists, developers, engineers, and oil and gas people, plus four staff from [Intelligent Plant](https://www.intelligentplant.com), and one from [BP](https://www.bp.com) as our resident domain experts. You can also find [Intelligent Plant on GitHub](https://github.com/intelligentplant) too.

This hack day provided participants with three data sources via the Intelligent Plant's App store: data from a Tesla car, a range of data from a home heating system, and data from a live production environment provided by BP. All of the data exploration happened through the app store, which meant there were no issues around data being taken away. BP and IP used the event to eplore different uses of the Intelligent Plant App Store.

[The Oil and Gas Technology Centre](https://www.theogtc.com) (OGTC) saw this as an opportunity for the to try different ways to foster innovation in the sector.

Attendees went through a process of ideation - addressing challenges and opportunities. Ideas were selected to work on and teams were formed to tackle these.
