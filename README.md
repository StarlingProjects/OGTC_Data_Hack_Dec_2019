# OGTC_Data_Hack_Dec_2019
A Data Hack at OGTC December 2019

This hack day provided participants with three data sources via the Intelligent Plant's App store: data from a Tesla car, a range of data from a home heating system and data from a live production environment provided by BP. 

Attendees went through a process of ideation - addressing challenges and opportunities. Ideas were selected to work on and teams were formed to tackle these.
