# OGTC_Data_Hack_Dec_2019
A Data Hack at OGTC 2 December 2019

We had 16 participants, who were data scientists, developers, engineers, and oil and gas people, plus four staff from [Intelligent Plant](https://www.intelligentplant.com), and one from [BP](https://www.bp.com) as our resident domain experts. 

This hack day provided participants with three data sources via the Intelligent Plant's App store: data from a Tesla car, a range of data from a home heating system, and data from a live production environment provided by BP. All of the data exploration happened through the app store, which meant there were no issues around data being taken away.

Attendees went through a process of ideation - addressing challenges and opportunities. Ideas were selected to work on and teams were formed to tackle these.
